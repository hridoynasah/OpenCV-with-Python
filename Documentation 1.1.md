They’re essential for tasks like aligning images or preparing them for analysis.

### What You’ll Learn
- **Translation**: Shift an image left, right, up, or down.
- **Rotation**: Rotate an image by an angle around a point.
- **Resizing**: Change an image’s size.
- **Flipping**: Mirror an image vertically, horizontally, or both.
- **Cropping**: Extract a specific part of an image.

### How to Use This Guide
Each section includes a code example you can run on your computer. Make sure you have Python, OpenCV, and NumPy installed (see the first tutorial for setup). Use an image file like `cat.jpg` in a `photos` folder, as referenced in the course’s [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jasmcaus/opencv-course).

# Python and OpenCV Course Documentation

This course, based on Jason Brownlee’s Python and OpenCV course, teaches computer vision using Python in a beginner-friendly way. It starts with basic operations and progresses to advanced techniques like face detection and deep learning models. This second tutorial focuses on **basic image transformations**, which are key for manipulating images in computer vision projects.

## Chapter 3: Basic Image Transformations

Image transformations change how an image looks or is positioned, much like editing a photo by sliding, rotating, or cutting it. These techniques are used in tasks like aligning images, preparing data for machine learning, or creating visual effects. This chapter covers five transformations: translation, rotation, resizing, flipping, and cropping.

### 3.1 Translation

Translation shifts an image along the x-axis (left or right) or y-axis (up or down). It’s like moving a picture on a table without turning it. This is useful for aligning images or creating effects like panning.

To translate an image, we create a **translation matrix** that specifies how many pixels to shift. The `cv2.warpAffine` function applies this shift.

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def translate(image, x, y):
    # Create a translation matrix
    transMat = np.float32([[1, 0, x], [0, 1, y]])
    # Get image dimensions
    rows, cols = image.shape[:2]
    # Apply translation
    translated = cv2.warpAffine(image, transMat, (cols, rows))
    return translated

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('photos/cat.jpg')
# Shift 100 pixels right and 100 pixels down
translated = translate(image, 100, 100)
# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Translated', translated)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

- **`x`**: Positive values shift right; negative values shift left.
- **`y`**: Positive values shift down; negative values shift up.
- **`np.float32`**: Ensures the matrix uses the correct data type for OpenCV.
- **`cv2.warpAffine`**: Applies the shift, keeping the image size the same.

**Try It**: Change `x` and `y` to `-100` to shift left and up. Notice how parts of the image may move out of view, replaced by black pixels.

### 3.2 Rotation

Rotation turns an image by a specific angle around a point, usually the center. It’s like spinning a photo on a pin. This helps align objects or create rotated versions of an image.

We use `cv2.getRotationMatrix2D` to create a rotation matrix, then apply it with `cv2.warpAffine`.

```python
def rotate(image, angle, rot_point=None):
    # Get image dimensions
    height, width = image.shape[:2]
    # Default rotation point is the center
    if rot_point is None:
        rot_point = (width // 2, height // 2)
    # Create rotation matrix
    rot_mat = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(rot_point, angle, 1.0)
    # Apply rotation
    rotated = cv2.warpAffine(image, rot_mat, (width, height))
    return rotated

# Rotate image by 45 degrees counterclockwise
rotated = rotate(image, 45)
# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Rotated', rotated)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

- **`angle`**: Positive values rotate counterclockwise; negative values rotate clockwise.
- **`rot_point`**: The point around which the image rotates (default is the center).
- **`1.0`**: Keeps the image scale unchanged during rotation.

**Try It**: Use `angle=-45` for clockwise rotation. Notice black triangles appearing in the corners, as the rotated image may not fully fit the original frame.

### 3.3 Resizing

Resizing changes an image’s dimensions, making it larger or smaller. It’s like zooming in or out of a photo. Resizing is crucial for fitting images to specific sizes or reducing processing time.

The `cv2.resize` function resizes the image, with options for how pixels are interpolated (smoothed).

```python
# Resize to 500x500 pixels
resized = cv2.resize(image, (500, 500), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Resized', resized)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

- **`interpolation`**:
  - `cv2.INTER_AREA`: Best for shrinking images.
  - `cv2.INTER_LINEAR`: Good for enlarging images.
  - `cv2.INTER_CUBIC`: Best for enlarging but slower, with higher quality.

**Try It**: Resize to `1000x1000` with `cv2.INTER_CUBIC` to see a smoother enlarged image.

### 3.4 Flipping

Flipping mirrors an image vertically, horizontally, or both. It’s like reflecting a photo in a mirror. This is useful for creating symmetrical effects or augmenting data for machine learning.

The `cv2.flip` function uses a flip code to specify the type of flip.

```python
# Flip vertically
flipped_vertical = cv2.flip(image, 0)
cv2.imshow(' - Flipped Vertical', flipped_vertical)
cv2.waitKey(0)

# Flip horizontally
flipped_horizontal = cv2.flip(image, 1)
cv2.imshow('Flipped Horizontal', flipped_horizontal)
cv2.waitKey(0)

# Flip both
flipped_both = cv2.flip(image, -1)
cv2.imshow('Flipped Both', flipped_both)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

- **`0`**: Flips over the x-axis (vertical).
- **`1`**: Flips over the y-axis (horizontal).
- **`-1`**: Flips both ways.

**Try It**: Compare the three flipped versions to see how the image changes.

### 3.5 Cropping

Cropping extracts a specific region from an image, like cutting a piece from a photo. It’s useful for focusing on a particular area or removing unwanted parts.

Since images are arrays, we use array slicing to crop.

```python
# Crop from (200, 200) to (400, 400)
cropped = image[200:400, 200:400]
# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Cropped', cropped)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

- **`[200:400, 200:400]`**: Selects a 200x200 pixel square starting at (200, 200).

**Try It**: Crop a different region, like `[100:300, 100:300]`, to see a different part of the image.

## Next Steps

You’ve now learned how to transform images using OpenCV. Practice by applying these transformations to your own images. Experiment with different values to see how they affect the results. In the next chapter, we’ll explore advanced topics like color spaces and edge detection.

# Python and OpenCV Course Documentation: Basic Image Transformations

This comprehensive guide is the second part of a Python and OpenCV course based on Jason Brownlee’s materials, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jasmcaus/opencv-course) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXlwWbU8l2o&t=360s). Designed for non-technical learners, it provides clear, step-by-step explanations of **basic image transformations**, a cornerstone of computer vision. This chapter covers **translation**, **rotation**, **resizing**, **flipping**, and **cropping**, with practical examples to help you master these techniques.

## Chapter 3: Basic Image Transformations

Image transformations modify an image’s position, orientation, or size, much like editing a photo by sliding, rotating, or cutting it. These operations are essential for tasks such as aligning images, preparing data for machine learning, or creating visual effects. This chapter introduces five fundamental transformations, explained with analogies and code examples to ensure clarity for beginners.

### 3.1 Translation

**What is Translation?**
- Translation shifts an image along the x-axis (left or right) or y-axis (up or down).
- It’s like sliding a picture across a table without rotating or resizing it.
- Use cases include aligning images in a panorama or creating motion effects.

**How Translation Works in OpenCV**
- A **translation matrix** defines the shift in pixels along x and y axes.
- The `cv2.warpAffine` function applies this matrix to move the image.
- Positive x shifts right, negative x shifts left; positive y shifts down, negative y shifts up.

**Code Example**

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

def translate(image, x, y):
    # Create a translation matrix
    transMat = np.float32([[1, 0, x], [0, 1, y]])
    # Get image dimensions
    rows, cols = image.shape[:2]
    # Apply translation
    translated = cv2.warpAffine(image, transMat, (cols, rows))
    return translated

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('photos/cat.jpg')
# Shift 100 pixels right and 100 pixels down
translated = translate(image, 100, 100)
# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Translated', translated)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation**
- **`transMat`**: A 2x3 matrix where `[x, y]` specifies the shift.
- **`image.shape[:2]`**: Gets the height and width of the image.
- **`cv2.warpAffine`**: Moves the image, filling empty areas with black pixels.
- **Output**: The image shifts 100 pixels right and down.

**Practice**
- Try `translate(image, -100, -100)` to shift left and up.
- Observe how parts of the image move out of view, replaced by black pixels.

### 3.2 Rotation

**What is Rotation?**
- Rotation turns an image by an angle around a point, typically the center.
- It’s like spinning a photo on a pin at its middle.
- Rotation is used to align objects or create rotated versions for analysis.

**How Rotation Works in OpenCV**
- `cv2.getRotationMatrix2D` creates a rotation matrix based on the angle and rotation point.
- `cv2.warpAffine` applies the rotation.
- Positive angles rotate counterclockwise; negative angles rotate clockwise.

**Code Example**

```python
def rotate(image, angle, rot_point=None):
    # Get image dimensions
    height, width = image.shape[:2]
    # Default rotation point is the center
    if rot_point is None:
        rot_point = (width // 2, height // 2)
    # Create rotation matrix
    rot_mat = cv2.getRotationMatrix2D(rot_point, angle, 1.0)
    # Apply rotation
    rotated = cv2.warpAffine(image, rot_mat, (width, height))
    return rotated

# Rotate image by 45 degrees counterclockwise
rotated = rotate(image, 45)
# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Rotated', rotated)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation**
- **`rot_point`**: Defaults to the image center (`width // 2, height // 2`).
- **`angle`**: 45 degrees rotates counterclockwise.
- **`1.0`**: Maintains the original scale (no zooming).
- **Output**: The image rotates, with black triangles in corners where the image doesn’t fit.

**Practice**
- Use `angle=-45` for clockwise rotation.
- Try rotating around a different point, like `(100, 100)`.

### 3.3 Resizing

**What is Resizing?**
- Resizing changes an image’s dimensions, making it larger or smaller.
- It’s like zooming in or out of a photo.
- Resizing is critical for fitting images to specific sizes or reducing computational load.

**How Resizing Works in OpenCV**
- `cv2.resize` adjusts the image to a new width and height.
- Interpolation methods control how pixels are smoothed during resizing.

**Code Example**

```python
# Resize to 500x500 pixels
resized = cv2.resize(image, (500, 500), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Resized', resized)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation**
- **`(500, 500)`**: New dimensions (width, height).
- **`cv2.INTER_AREA`**: Ideal for shrinking images, providing smooth results.
- **Output**: The image is resized to 500x500 pixels.

**Interpolation Options**
- `cv2.INTER_AREA`: Best for reducing size.
- `cv2.INTER_LINEAR`: Good for enlarging, faster but less sharp.
- `cv2.INTER_CUBIC`: Best for enlarging, slower but higher quality.

**Practice**
- Resize to `1000x1000` with `cv2.INTER_CUBIC` to compare quality.
- Try resizing to non-square dimensions, like `(600, 400)`.

### 3.4 Flipping

**What is Flipping?**
- Flipping mirrors an image vertically, horizontally, or both.
- It’s like reflecting a photo in a mirror.
- Flipping is used for creating symmetrical effects or augmenting data for machine learning.

**How Flipping Works in OpenCV**
- `cv2.flip` uses a flip code to specify the mirroring direction.
- Codes: `0` (vertical), `1` (horizontal), `-1` (both).

**Code Example**

```python
# Flip vertically
flipped_vertical = cv2.flip(image, 0)
cv2.imshow('Flipped Vertical', flipped_vertical)
cv2.waitKey(0)

# Flip horizontally
flipped_horizontal = cv2.flip(image, 1)
cv2.imshow('Flipped Horizontal', flipped_horizontal)
cv2.waitKey(0)

# Flip both
flipped_both = cv2.flip(image, -1)
cv2.imshow('Flipped Both', flipped_both)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation**
- **`0`**: Mirrors over the x-axis, flipping top to bottom.
- **`1`**: Mirrors over the y-axis, flipping left to right.
- **`-1`**: Combines both flips.
- **Output**: Three mirrored versions of the image.

**Practice**
- Compare the flipped images side by side to see the mirroring effect.
- Try flipping a non-symmetrical image to notice the changes clearly.

### 3.5 Cropping

**What is Cropping?**
- Cropping extracts a specific region from an image.
- It’s like cutting a section from a photo with scissors.
- Cropping is useful for focusing on a particular area or removing unwanted parts.

**How Cropping Works in OpenCV**
- Images are arrays, so we use array slicing to select a region.
- Specify row and column ranges to define the crop area.

**Code Example**

```python
# Crop from (200, 200) to (400, 400)
cropped = image[200:400, 200:400]
# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Cropped', cropped)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

**Explanation**
- **`[200:400, 200:400]`**: Selects a 200x200 pixel square starting at (200, 200).
- **Output**: Only the cropped region is displayed.

**Practice**
- Crop a different region, like `[100:300, 100:300]`.
- Try cropping a rectangular region, like `[100:300, 200:500]`.
