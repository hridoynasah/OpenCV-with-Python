# Python and OpenCV Course Documentation

This course is designed to teach you how to use Python and OpenCV for computer vision tasks. Whether you're new to programming or have some experience, this guide will help you understand the concepts step by step. Think of OpenCV as a toolbox for working with images and videos—much like how you might use a photo editor but with code instead of clicks.

We'll start with the basics, like reading images and videos, and gradually move to more advanced topics like detecting faces and building a model to recognize characters from *The Simpsons*. By the end, you'll have a solid foundation in computer vision using Python.

## Chapter 1: Introduction to Python and OpenCV

### 1.1 What is OpenCV?

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful library that lets you work with images and videos in Python. It's like having a set of tools for tasks such as:
- Reading and displaying images
- Processing videos
- Detecting objects (like faces)
- Building advanced models for image recognition

OpenCV is widely used because it's powerful yet easy to use, especially for beginners.

### 1.2 Course Overview

This course will cover:
- **Basics**: Reading images and videos, resizing them, and drawing shapes or text.
- **Advanced Concepts**: Working with colors, detecting edges, and applying filters.
- **Face Detection and Recognition**: How to find and identify faces in images.
- **Capstone Project**: Building a model to classify characters from *The Simpsons*.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to create your own computer vision projects using Python and OpenCV.

### 1.3 Setting Up Your Environment

Before we start coding, you need to set up your computer with the right tools.

1. **Check Python Version**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Type `python --version` and press Enter.
   - You should see a version number like `Python 3.x.x`. Make sure it's at least 3.7 or higher. If not, download the latest version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install OpenCV**:
   - In your terminal, run:
     ```bash
     pip install opencv-contrib-python
     ```
   - This installs OpenCV along with extra modules that provide additional functionality.

3. **Install Caer (Optional)**:
   - Caer is a helper library created by the instructor for computer vision tasks.
   - Install it with:
     ```bash
     pip install caer
     ```
   - While not required for most of the course, it can make your workflow easier later on.

Now that your environment is ready, let's dive into the basics of working with images and videos.

## Chapter 2: Reading Images and Videos

### 2.1 Reading Images

Imagine you want to open a photo on your computer. With OpenCV, you can do this programmatically. The function `cv2.imread` lets you read an image file into your program.

Here's an example:
```python
import cv2

# Read an image file
img = cv2.imread('photos/cat.jpg')

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Cat', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

- **`cv2.imread('photos/cat.jpg')`** reads the image file located at `'photos/cat.jpg'`. Make sure the file exists in that path relative to your current working directory.
- **`cv2.imshow('Cat', img)`** displays the image in a window titled "Cat".
- **`cv2.waitKey(0)`** keeps the window open until you press a key.

**Note**: If your image is very large, it might not fit on your screen. We'll learn how to resize images later.

### 2.2 Reading Videos

Videos are just a sequence of images (called frames) played quickly. OpenCV lets you read videos frame by frame using the `cv2.VideoCapture` class.

Here's how to read and display a video:
```python
import cv2

# Initialize video capture
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('videos/dog.mp4')

while True:
    # Read a frame
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    
    # If the frame was not read successfully, break the loop
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow('Video', frame)
    
    # Break the loop if 'd' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(20) & 0xFF == ord('d'):
        break

# Release the video capture object
cap.release()
# Close all OpenCV windows
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

- **`cv2.VideoCapture('videos/dog.mp4')`** opens the video file `'videos/dog.mp4'`.
- **`cap.read()`** reads one frame at a time. It returns `ret` (a boolean indicating success) and `frame` (the current frame).
- **`cv2.imshow('Video', frame)`** displays each frame.
- **`cv2.waitKey(20)`** waits for 20 milliseconds. If you press 'd', the loop stops.
- **`cap.release()`** frees up the video file, and **`cv2.destroyAllWindows()`** closes all OpenCV windows.

This way, you can play and process videos using OpenCV.

### 2.3 Resizing and Rescaling

Sometimes images or videos are too large to work with comfortably. Resizing them helps reduce computational strain and makes them easier to display.

OpenCV provides the `cv2.resize` function for resizing. Let's create a helper function to rescale images or frames:
```python
def rescale_frame(frame, scale=0.75):
    # Get the current height and width
    height = frame.shape[0]
    width = frame.shape[1]
    
    # Calculate new dimensions
    new_height = int(height * scale)
    new_width = int(width * scale)
    
    # Resize the frame
    return cv2.resize(frame, (new_width, new_height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
```

- **`scale`** is a factor (e.g., 0.75 means 75% of the original size).
- **`frame.shape[0]`** and **`frame.shape[1]`** give the height and width of the image or frame.
- **`cv2.resize`** resizes the frame to the new dimensions.

You can use this function for images:
```python
resized_img = rescale_frame(img)
cv2.imshow('Resized Image', resized_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

Or for videos:
```python
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    resized_frame = rescale_frame(frame)
    cv2.imshow('Resized Video', resized_frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(20) & 0xFF == ord('d'):
        break
```

**Tip**: For live video from a webcam, you can set the resolution directly:
```python
cap.set(3, 640)  # Set width to 640 pixels
cap.set(4, 480)  # Set height to 480 pixels
```

### 2.4 Drawing Shapes and Text

OpenCV also lets you draw on images, which is useful for adding annotations or creating visual effects. Let's start by creating a blank image:
```python
import numpy as np

# Create a blank 500x500 image with 3 color channels (BGR)
blank = np.zeros((500, 500, 3), dtype='uint8')
```

Now, let's draw some shapes and text.

#### 2.4.1 Drawing a Rectangle
```python
cv2.rectangle(blank, (0, 0), (250, 250), (0, 255, 0), 2)
cv2.imshow('Rectangle', blank)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
- **`(0, 0)`** is the top-left corner.
- **`(250, 250)`** is the bottom-right corner.
- **`(0, 255, 0)`** is the color (green in BGR format).
- **`2`** is the thickness of the border.

To fill the rectangle:
```python
cv2.rectangle(blank, (0, 0), (250, 250), (0, 255, 0), cv2.FILLED)
```

#### 2.4.2 Drawing a Circle
```python
cv2.circle(blank, (250, 250), 40, (0, 0, 255), -1)
cv2.imshow('Circle', blank)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
- **`(250, 250)`** is the center.
- **`40`** is the radius.
- **`(0, 0, 255)`** is red.
- **`-1`** fills the circle.

#### 2.4.3 Drawing a Line
```python
cv2.line(blank, (0, 0), (250, 250), (255, 0, 0), 3)
cv2.imshow('Line', blank)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
- From **`(0, 0)`** to **`(250, 250)`**.
- Color is blue **`(255, 0, 0)`**.
- Thickness is **`3`**.

#### 2.4.4 Writing Text
```python
cv2.putText(blank, 'Hello, World!', (25, 25), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1.0, (0, 255, 0), 2)
cv2.imshow('Text', blank)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
- Text: `'Hello, World!'`
- Position: **`(25, 25)`**
- Font: **`cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX`**
- Scale: **`1.0`**
- Color: Green **`(0, 255, 0)`**
- Thickness: **`2`**

These functions allow you to add shapes and text to images for various purposes, like labeling objects or creating visual effects.

With your environment set up, you’re ready to start working with images and videos.

#### Chapter 2: Reading Images and Videos

##### 2.1 Reading Images
Reading an image in OpenCV is like opening a photo in a viewer, but you’re doing it with code. The `cv2.imread` function loads an image file into your program as a matrix of pixels.

Here’s a sample code:
```python
import cv2

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('photos/cat.jpg')

# Show the image in a window
cv2.imshow('Cat', img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

- **`cv2.imread('photos/cat.jpg')`**: Reads the image from the specified path. Ensure the file exists in the `photos` folder relative to your script.
- **`cv2.imshow('Cat', img)`**: Displays the image in a window named “Cat”.
- **`cv2.waitKey(0)`**: Pauses the program until you press a key, keeping the window open.

**Note**: If the image path is incorrect, you’ll get an error (e.g., -215 assertion failed). Double-check the file path and name.

##### 2.2 Reading Videos
Videos are sequences of images (frames) displayed rapidly. OpenCV’s `cv2.VideoCapture` class lets you read videos frame by frame, either from a file or a webcam.

Here’s how to read a video file:
```python
import cv2

# Open the video file
cap = cv2.VideoCapture('videos/dog.mp4')

while True:
    # Read the next frame
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    
    # Exit if no more frames
    if not ret:
        break
    
    # Display the frame
    cv2.imshow('Video', frame)
    
    # Stop if 'd' is pressed
    if cv2.waitKey(20) & 0xFF == ord('d'):
        break

# Clean up
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

- **`cv2.VideoCapture('videos/dog.mp4')`**: Opens the video file.
- **`cap.read()`**: Returns `ret` (True if the frame was read successfully) and `frame` (the image data).
- **`cv2.imshow('Video', frame)`**: Shows each frame in a window.
- **`cv2.waitKey(20)`**: Waits 20 milliseconds per frame. Pressing ‘d’ exits the loop.
- **`cap.release()`** and **`cv2.destroyAllWindows()`**: Free resources and close windows.

For webcam input, replace `'videos/dog.mp4'` with `0` (or another integer for additional cameras).

**Table 2: Common OpenCV Functions for Reading Media**
| Function            | Purpose                              | Parameters                              |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `cv2.imread`        | Reads an image file                  | Path to image file                      |
| `cv2.imshow`        | Displays an image or frame           | Window name, image/frame data           |
| `cv2.waitKey`       | Waits for a key press                | Delay in milliseconds (0 for infinite)  |
| `cv2.VideoCapture`  | Initializes video capture            | File path or camera index               |
| `cap.read`          | Reads a video frame                  | Returns success boolean, frame data     |
| `cap.release`       | Frees video capture resources        | None                                    |
| `cv2.destroyAllWindows` | Closes all OpenCV windows        | None                                    |

##### 2.3 Resizing and Rescaling
Large images or videos can slow down your program or exceed your screen size. Resizing reduces their dimensions, making them easier to handle. OpenCV’s `cv2.resize` function is used for this.

Here’s a custom function to rescale images or video frames:
```python
def rescale_frame(frame, scale=0.75):
    # Get current dimensions
    height = frame.shape[0]
    width = frame.shape[1]
    
    # Calculate new dimensions
    new_height = int(height * scale)
    new_width = int(width * scale)
    
    # Resize the frame
    return cv2.resize(frame, (new_width, new_height), interpolation=cv2.INTER_AREA)
```

- **`scale`**: A multiplier (e.g., 0.75 for 75% of original size).
- **`frame.shape[0]`** and **`frame.shape[1]`**: Height and width of the image/frame.
- **`cv2.resize`**: Resizes to the new dimensions, using `INTER_AREA` for smooth scaling.

Apply it to an image:
```python
resized_img = rescale_frame(img)
cv2.imshow('Resized Image', resized_img)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```

Or to a video:
```python
while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        break
    resized_frame = rescale_frame(frame)
    cv2.imshow('Resized Video', resized_frame)
    if cv2.waitKey(20) & 0xFF == ord('d'):
        break
```

For live video (e.g., webcam), you can set resolution directly:
```python
cap.set(3, 640)  # Width
cap.set(4, 480)  # Height
```

This is useful for real-time feeds but doesn’t work for pre-recorded videos.

##### 2.4 Drawing Shapes and Text
Drawing on images is like using a digital pen to add annotations or effects. OpenCV provides functions to draw shapes and text.

Start with a blank image:
```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 500x500 black image with 3 color channels (BGR)
blank = np.zeros((500, 500, 3), dtype='uint8')
```

**2.4.1 Drawing a Rectangle**
```python
cv2.rectangle(blank, (0, 0), (250, 250), (0, 255, 0), 2)
cv2.imshow('Rectangle', blank)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
- **`(0, 0)`**: Top-left corner.
- **`(250, 250)`**: Bottom-right corner.
- **`(0, 255, 0)`**: Green (BGR format).
- **`2`**: Border thickness.

For a filled rectangle, use `cv2.FILLED` or `-1`:
```python
cv2.rectangle(blank, (0, 0), (250, 250), (0, 255, 0), cv2.FILLED)
```

**2.4.2 Drawing a Circle**
```python
cv2.circle(blank, (250, 250), 40, (0, 0, 255), -1)
cv2.imshow('Circle', blank)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
- **`(250, 250)`**: Center.
- **`40`**: Radius.
- **`(0, 0, 255)`**: Red.
- **`-1`**: Fills the circle.

**2.4.3 Drawing a Line**
```python
cv2.line(blank, (0, 0), (250, 250), (255, 0, 0), 3)
cv2.imshow('Line', blank)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
- From **`(0, 0)`** to **`(250, 250)`**.
- **`(255, 0, 0)`**: Blue.
- **`3`**: Thickness.

**2.4.4 Writing Text**
```python
cv2.putText(blank, 'Hello, World!', (25, 25), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX, 1.0, (0, 255, 0), 2)
cv2.imshow('Text', blank)
cv2.waitKey(0)
```
- **`'Hello, World!'`**: Text to display.
- **`(25, 25)`**: Starting position.
- **`cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX`**: Font style.
- **`1.0`**: Font scale.
- **`(0, 255, 0)`**: Green.
- **`2`**: Thickness.

**Table 3: OpenCV Drawing Functions**
| Function         | Purpose                     | Key Parameters                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `cv2.rectangle`  | Draws a rectangle           | Image, top-left, bottom-right, color, thickness |
| `cv2.circle`     | Draws a circle              | Image, center, radius, color, thickness      |
| `cv2.line`       | Draws a line                | Image, start point, end point, color, thickness |
| `cv2.putText`    | Writes text                 | Image, text, position, font, scale, color, thickness |

These functions are versatile for annotating images or creating custom visuals.

#### Next Steps
This guide covers the foundational skills for working with OpenCV. Future chapters will explore advanced topics like color spaces, edge detection, and face recognition.
